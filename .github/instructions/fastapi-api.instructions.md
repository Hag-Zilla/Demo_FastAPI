## Purpose

Guide Copilot output for FastAPI modules with pragmatic, production-oriented defaults.

## Scope

Applies to FastAPI API code in `services/api/`.

## Guidelines

### Pydantic and Validation

- Prefer Pydantic v2 `BaseModel` for request and response payloads.
- Use explicit type hints for model fields and endpoint signatures.
- Prefer `Field()` constraints for OpenAPI clarity and input quality.
- Add `example` or `examples` where it improves API discoverability.

### Endpoints and Routing

- Prefer one domain per `APIRouter()` instead of a monolithic main module.
- Set explicit `status_code` when behavior is known.
- Add concise docstrings for route handlers, especially for non-trivial logic.
- Use `HTTPException` and shared exception handlers for consistent API errors.

### Testing

- Prefer `pytest` with `TestClient` for endpoint validation.
- Cover happy path, invalid input, and at least one edge case.
- Use fixtures for reusable client setup and dependency overrides.

### Observability

- Prefer structured logging for request lifecycle events.
- Add request count and latency metrics with Prometheus instrumentation when relevant.
- Include endpoint context in exception logs.

### Security and Performance

- Configure CORS explicitly and avoid permissive defaults in production.
- Prefer dependency-injected auth (`Depends`) for protected endpoints.
- Use `async def` for I/O-bound handlers.
- Consider rate limiting and caching for public or high-traffic endpoints.

### Error Handling

- Define a custom exception hierarchy rooted at a base `APIError` class.
- Raise specific subclasses (`NotFoundError`, `AuthorizationError`, `ValidationError`)
  with descriptive messages; never raise bare `Exception`.
- Map custom exceptions to `HTTPException` in a shared exception handler, not inline
  in route functions.
- Never silently swallow exceptions with a bare `except: pass`.

## Examples

### Dependencies

Use `Annotated[Type, Depends(...)]` for all FastAPI dependency injection:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import Depends

async def endpoint(
    user: Annotated[User, Depends(get_current_user)],
    db: Annotated[Session, Depends(get_db)],
) -> ResponseModel:
    ...

- Never pass dependencies as plain function arguments without `Depends`.
- Define `__all__` in router modules to make the public API surface explicit.

## Examples

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, status

router = APIRouter(prefix="/health", tags=["health"])


@router.get("", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
async def health() -> dict[str, str]:
    """Return service health status."""
    return {"status": "ok"}
```
